# Sortify - Sort your favorite songs by mood and discover new music

Sortify is a web application designed to be a hub for Spotify users to organize their favorite songs and receive recommendations from those songs. After authenticating their profile through Spotify, the user is welcomed by a dashboard with their top tracks, sorted into 5 playlists by mood, as well as a list of song recommendations for each mood. The user is able to add these recommendations to one of the created playlists or search for any song in Spotify's library to add. The app also provides the ability to preview songs, shuffle playlists, remove songs from playlists, and save the playlists to the user's Spotify account.
